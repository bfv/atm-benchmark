These add on files are based on the original files from ghb. The purpose of
these files is to make a port for Wintel machines and thus be able to benchmark
with ATM on these systems running Microsoft Windows operating system.

The shell scripts were converted into batch files without any change of
functionality. Changes have been made to the driver.p file that now creates a
launch.bat file to launch the benchmark client processes. The file is after the
test completes deleted. For the purpose of coextistence of teh two versions of
ATM the modified driver.p was named drivernt.p.

Just in case it is not obvious, you need to create extract the files to 
the C:\ directory.  This will create the C:\Progress\Class\Atm directory and
load the files there.  Once this is done, you can run the BUILD.BAT script to
create the ATM database and the GO.BAT scripts to demo tuning techniques.
